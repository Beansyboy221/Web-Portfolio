                <p class="scrollanim fade">
                    I am a full-stack developer with a passion for innovation.
                    I recently graduated from Norwich University with a 3.99 GPA and a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
                    Minoring in Mathematics has helped me develop a strong understanding of algorithms and proofs.
                    I have experience with Python, C#, Lua, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                    <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy playing video games, programming, and trying new foods.
                        I am also interested in computer hardware and user-interface design.
                        I am always looking for new projects and people to work with.

                    <p>
                        I am a minimalist at heart and I believe that less is more.
                        I value simplicity, efficiency, and quality in everything I do.
                        Organization and communication in a team environment are also very important to me.

                    <h3>Deep Learning Anti-Cheat</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have been working on a universal deep learning anti-cheat system that enables developers
                        to train and deploy time-series analysis models to detect anomalous user inputs or 
                        classify user input patterns as cheating or not cheating.

                    <!-- <h3>Touchscreen WinForms Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        During my internship at Echo Point Books & Media in Brattleboro, VT,
                        I developed a touchscreen application in C# using WinForms.
                        The application was used to document the condition of returned packages and books.
                        It involved a database connection, barcode scanning, and a usb camera api.

                    <!-- <h3>Lua Scripting in Garry's Mod</h3>
                    <p>
                        Using the gLua API, I have programmed several addons and scripts. 
                        Some of the scripts I have created include: a crash preventer and a hit-registration fix plugin.
                        These projects helped build my understanding of game engines and vector spaces.

                    <!-- <h3>Object Detection with OpenCV Python</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have independently researched computer vision algorithms for a project in college. 
                        I wrote a basic program in Python that utilized a pre-trained cascade model 
                        to detect people and faces in an image or live video feed.
