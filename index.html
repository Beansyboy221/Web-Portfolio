                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a full-stack developer with a passion for software development.
                    I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at Norwich University.
                    I have experience with Python, C#, Lua, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    I am also minoring in mathematics in the hope of expanding my knowledge of algorithms and data structures.

                        I enjoy playing video games, programming, and trying new foods.
                        I am also interested in computer hardware and user-interface design.
                        I am always looking for new projects and people to work with.

                        I am a minimalist at heart and I believe that less is more.
                        I value simplicity, efficiency, and quality in everything I do.

                    <p>
                        I have briefly experimented with computer vision algorithms for a project in college. 
                        I wrote a basic program in Python that utilized a pre-trained cascade model 
                        to detect people and faces in an image or live video feed.

                    <p>
                        Using the built in gLua libraries, I have programmed several addons and scripts. 
                        Some of the scripts I have created include: a crash preventer, a hit-registration fix plugin, and ######.

                    <h3>Touchscreen WinForms Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        During my internship at Echo Point Books & Media in Brattleboro, VT,
                        I developed a touchscreen application in C# using WinForms.
                        The application was used to document the condition of returned packages and books.
                        It involved a database connection, barcode scanning, and a usb camera api.
